## Development History

Throughout development, the project met various milestones to ensure sufficient progress of the application was being made.
### <a href="https://github.com/orgs/thats-my-spot/projects/1/views/1">Milestone 1</a>

The goals of milestone 1 were to create mockup sketches of the site's pages and create some of the actual pages based on the sketches, as well as develop some of the backend by including the parking pass field to the account collection and adding the stalls collection.

### <a href="https://github.com/orgs/thats-my-spot/projects/2/views/1">Milestone 2</a>

The goals of milestone 2 were to continue development of the backend processes and the actual site pages based on the sketches, add a domain name for the website, and employ HTTPS.
